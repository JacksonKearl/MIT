    My previous experience with writing is limited to school work. I took AP Language and Composition in high school, where I had some practice analyzing rhetoric of things like political speeches and various other writings, mainly narratives. Other than that, I've done manly the standard literary analysis of "the classics" as taught in school. 

    I think it's possible that I could like writing, were my writings less often deemed inadequate. From SAT and ACT to FEE and AP, I've never really tested well in writing, which over time has grown disheartening. 

    I'd like to do mainly computer science or computer programming. for the former, I suppose it would be a more theoretical field, so some experience in formal, scholarly writing would be worthwhile. For the latter, I don't see myself needing to write as much. 

    Usually I will approach writing in a very piecewise manner: going one paragraph at a time, for anywhere from one to maybe five paragraphs before I have to escape. Historically, I haven't been as good with any sort of prewriting, but I feel more of that could help me.

    I think I'm alright with getting the ideas down, but I struggle more with connecting with the audience in terms of diction and introductions and conclusions. 

    From this class I'd like to learn more about formal writing, because thats what I see myself doing most in the future.

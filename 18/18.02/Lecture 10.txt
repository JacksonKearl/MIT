Directional Derivatives:

directional derivative in direction of v=
del f dot unit vector in v

f(theta) = arctan(y/x)

del f = theta_x i + theta_y j
= -y/(x^2+y^2) i + x/(x^2+y^2) j



GRAD(F) = FX I + FY J + FZ K

Points in direction of increasing f

mag grad f  = directional derivative in direction of del f

perpendicular to level surfaces in 

w = distance from origin
level surfaces = concentric spheres
grad w = x/r i + y/r j + z/r k
= 1/r (xi + yj + zk)

|grad w| = 1/r sqrt(xx + yy + zz) = r/r = 1



Handy Application!
find normal vectors to surfaces and tangent planes
Old way:
tangent to z=f(x,y) at point p = (p0) is
z-z0 = fx(p0)(x-x0) + fy(p0)(y-y0)

New way:
think of surface as level surface.
the normal to surface is given by grad
Deduce tangent plane from normal and point

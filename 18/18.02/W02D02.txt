theorem 1
if def a != 0, Ax = B has unique solution x = A^-1 B
if def A != 0, Ax = 0 has unique solution x = null vector (trivial)

theorem 2
if def a = 0, Ax = 0 has infinite num of non trivial solutions
if def a = 0, Ax = B has either no solution or infinite

     det A         !det A
B     1           0 or inf
!B    1 (trivial) 0 or inf


for homogenous system:
2x + y + z = 0
4x + 0 +3z = 0
x + cy + 0 = 0

what value of c give non trivial solutions

A non trivial solution for homo system only if det a != 0. 



Equations of a plane

normal to plane. need point to totally define

find the plane through a point P = (x,y,x) and normal to vector P = (a,b,c)

case 2 
find the plane through 3 points

P0 = 1,0,0 
P1 = 1,2,3 
P2 = 1,1,0

cross P0 and P1 to get vector for plane.

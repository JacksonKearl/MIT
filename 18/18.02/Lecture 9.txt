vector fields, gradients

scalar field: z = f(x,y)

gives a z for each x,y

defines surface in 3d,
 level curves in x, y plane

like a topo map!

Vector Field

F(x,y) -> defines a vector quantity corresponding to each point (x,y)

F = f(x,y)i + f(x,y)j has scalar components, f and f

Ex 1. Flux field
F = 1/(x^2+y^2) (xi + yj)
Concentric circles, magnitude decorating as you go outwards
Such as velocity field by point source at (0,0)
or electric field

Ex 2. rotational field
F = -yi + xj = k X r (cross product)
velocity field associated with solid body rotation 



Gradient
indicates the directional rate of change of a scalar function in xy-plane

Def: the gradient=
grad(f) = partial wrt x i + partial wrt y j + ...

Properties of gradient field:
perpendicular/normal to level curves/planes
points up! direction of maximum increase of f
magnitude gives indication of steepness.
Note: grad f(x,y) is defined on contour map (x,y plane) but has no z component.

Ex. temperature
temp = f(x,y)
grad f(x,y) gives where we should go to warm up. 

Directional derivative
amount to which a field is changing in a given direction. 
Just project the gradient onto the direction.

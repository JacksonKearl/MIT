Curvature

How do we quantify? 

Tangent circle, radius R

Radius of curvature R of curve C at point P:
is that of the curvature of the tangent circle to the curve

Radius of curvature R > 0 
Curvature = kappa = 1/R

Curvature in the plane

If phi is the angle that T makes with Ox,
then: 
T = cos phi i hat + sin phi j hat
N = k hat cross T = -sin phi i hat + cos j hat

T cross N = k
N = k cross T
-N also normal

if the path is parametric in terms of arc length:
r(s) = x(s)i + y(s)j

We know T = dr/ds = dx/ds i + dy/ds j

dx/ds = cos phi
dy/ds = sin phi

if given in form s = s(phi)
Consider 2 points (s, phi) and (s+ds, phi + d phi).
As ds -> 0, these points concede, and the circle touching both tangents 
will have the same radius. , since ds = R d phi 

Radius of Curvature: R = ds/d phi = 1/kappa

kappa = d phi/ds
ex. 1 : straight line: phi is const, indeed of s
K = 0, R = 1/k ->

Circle: s = a theta
phi = theta + pi/2
K = d phi/ds = 1/a



CALCULATING K FROM CARTESIAN EQUATIONS FOR A CURVE
r = x(t)i + y(t)j

T = cos phi i + sin phi j
dT/ds = (-sin phi i + cos phi j) d phi/ds = kN
For a trajectroy cureve r = r(t)
vec(v) = dr/dt = ds/dtT = vT
vec(a) = dV/dt = d/dt(ds/dt T) = d2s/dt2 T + ds/dt dT/ds ds/dt via chain

Nw since dT/ds = kN, 
vec(a) = d2s/dt2 T + k(ds/dt)^2N
For motion in a plane, we thus see the 2 components of acceleration

Linear acceleration: d2s/dt2 = d|v|/dt in tangential dir
Centripital accel  : 
kappa(ds/dt)^2 = kappa|v|^2 = v^2/R

m vec(a) = m[d^2s/dt^2 T + v^2/R N^] = sum forces

m d^2s/dt^2 T = sum  foreces - m * V^2/R N

v = |v|  T = vT
and a = dV/dt T + kappa V^2 N

we find V cross a = V T cross (dv/dt T + kappa v^2 N)

= kappa v^3 TxN = kappa v^3 k

kappa = k * (v cross a)/|v|^3 = |v cross a|/|v|^3

given trajectory equation: 


k * (v cross a) = dx/dt d2y/dt2 = dy/d d2x/dt2
|v|^3 = [(dx/dt)^2 + (dy/dt)^2]^3/2

kappa = x'y'' - y'x'' / (x'^2 + y'^2)^(3/2) = 1/R

for cyrves y = f(x), set x=t, y=f(t)

kappa = 1/R = y''/[1+y'^(3/2)]
